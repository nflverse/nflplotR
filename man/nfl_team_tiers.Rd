\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that has to include the variables \code{tier_no} (the
number of the tier starting from the top tier no. 1) and \code{team_abbr} (the
team abbreviation). \code{team_abbr} should be one of \code{\link[=valid_team_names]{valid_team_names()}} and
the function tries to clean team names internally by calling
\code{\link[nflreadr:clean_team_abbrs]{nflreadr::clean_team_abbrs()}}. If data includes the variable \code{tier_rank},
these ranks will be used within each tier. Otherwise, if \code{presort = FALSE},
the function will assume that data is already sorted and if \code{presort = TRUE},
teams will be sorted alphabetically within tiers.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{subtitle}{The subtitle of the plot.}

\item{caption}{The caption of the plot.}

\item{tier_desc}{A named vector consisting of the tier descriptions. The names
must equal the tier numbers from \code{tier_no}}

\item{presort}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the function assumes that the teams
are already sorted within the tiers. Will otherwise sort alphabetically.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha channel of the logos, i.e. transparency level, as a
numerical value between 0 and 1.}

\item{width}{The desired width of the logo in \code{npc} (Normalised Parent Coordinates).}

\item{no_line_below_tier}{Vector of tier numbers. The function won't draw tier
separation lines below these tiers. This is intended to be used for tiers
that shall be combined (see examples).}

\item{devel}{Determines if logos shall be rendered. If \code{FALSE} (the default),
logos will be rendered on each run. If \code{TRUE} the team abbreviations will be
plotted instead of the logos. This is much faster and helps with the plot
development.}

This function sets up a ggplot to visualize NFL team tiers.
